<p>FastSync is an element of the Lachesis protocol which enables nodes to catch up
with other nodes without downloading and processing the entire history of gossip
(Poset + Blockchain). It is important in the context of mobile ad hoc
networks where users dynamically create or join groups, and where limited
computing resources call for periodic pruning of the underlying data store. The
solution relies on linking snapshots of the application state to independent and
self-contained sections of the Poset, called Frames. A node that fell back
too far may fast-forward straight to the latest snapshot, initialize a new
Poset from the corresponding Frame, and get up to speed with the other nodes
without downloading and processing all the transactions it missed. Of course,
the protocol maintains the BFT properties of the base algorithm by packaging
relevant data in signed blocks; here again we see the benefits of using a
blockchain mapping on top of Poset. Although implementing the
Snapshot/Restore functionality puts extra strain on the application developer,
it remains entirely optional; FastSync can be activated or deactivated via
configuration.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/fastsync.png" src="_images/fastsync.png" />
<p>The Lachesis node is implemented as a state machine where the possible states are:
<strong>Babbling</strong>, <strong>CatchingUp</strong>, and <strong>Shutdown</strong>. A node is normally in the
<strong>Babbling</strong> state where it performs the regular Poset gossip routines, but
a <strong>sync_limit</strong> response from a peer will trigger the node to enter the
<strong>CatchingUp</strong> state, where it will attempt to fast-forward to a recent
snapshot. A <strong>sync_limit</strong> response indicates that the number of Events that the
node needs to download exceeds the <strong>sync_limit</strong> configuration value.</p>
<p>In the <strong>CatchingUp</strong> state, a node repeatedly chooses another node at random
(although the above diagram uses the same peer that returned the <strong>sync_limit</strong>
response) and attempts to fast-forward to their last consensus snapshot, until
the operation succeeds. Hence, FastSync introduces a new type of command in the
communication protocol: <em>FastForward</em>.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a FastForwardRequest, a node must respond with the last consensus
snapshot, as well as the corresponding Poset section (the Frame) and Block.
With this information, and having verified the Block signatures against the
other items as well as the known validator set, the requesting node attempts to
reset its Poset from the Frame, and restore the application from the
snapshot. The difficulty resides in defining what is meant by <em>last consensus</em>
snapshot, and how to package enough information in the Frames as to form a base
for a new/pruned Poset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="frames">
<h2>Frames<a class="headerlink" href="#frames" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Frames are self-contained sections of the Poset. They are composed of Roots
and regular Poset Events, where Roots are the base on top of which Events
can be inserted. Basically, Frames form a valid foundation for a new Poset,
such that gossip-about-gossip routines are not discontinued, while earlier
records of the gossip history are ignored.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A Frame corresponds to a Poset consensus round. Indeed, the consensus
algorithm commits Events in batches, which we map onto Frames, and finally onto
a Blockchain. This is an evolution of the previously defined <a class="reference internal" href="blockchain.html#blockchain"><span class="std std-ref">blockchain
mapping</span></a>. Block headers now contain a Frame hash. As we will see
later, this is useful for security. The Events in a Frame are the Events of the
corresponding batch, in consensus order.</p>
<img alt="_images/dag_frames_bx.png" src="_images/dag_frames_bx.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="roots">
<h2>Roots<a class="headerlink" href="#roots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Frames also contain Roots. To get an understanding for why this is necessary, we
must consider the initial state of a Poset, i.e., the base on top of which
the first Events are inserted.</p>
<p>The Poset is an interlinked chain of Events, where each Event contains two
references to anterior Events (SelfParent and OtherParent). Upon inserting an
Event in the Poset, we check that its references point to existing Events
(Events that are already in the Poset) and that at least the SelfParent
reference is not empty. This is partially illustrated in the following picture
where Event A2 cannot be inserted because its references are unknown.</p>
<img alt="_images/roots_0.png" src="_images/roots_0.png" />
<p>So what about the first Event? Until now, we simply implemented a special case,
whereby the first Event for any participant, could be inserted without checking
its references. In fact the above picture shows that Events A0, B0, and C0, have
empty references, and yet they are part of the Poset. This special case is
fine as long as we do not expect to initialize Posets from a ‘non-zero’
state.</p>
<p>We introduced the concept of Roots to remove the special case and handle more
general situations. They make it possible to initialize a Poset from a
section of an existing Poset, and discard everything below it.</p>
<img alt="_images/roots_1.png" src="_images/roots_1.png" />
<p>A Root is a data structure containing condensed information about the dominators
of the first Events to be added to the Poset. Each participant has a Root,
containing a <em>SelfParent</em> - the direct dominator of the first Event for the
corresponding participant - and <em>Others</em> - a map of Event hashes to the
corresponding Other-Parents. These parents are instances of the <strong>RootEvent</strong>
object, which is a minimal version of the Poset Event. RootEvents contain
information about the Index, Round, and LamportTimestamp of the corresponding
Events. The Root itself contains a NextRound field, which helps in calculating
the Round of its direct dominated.</p>

<h2>Algorithm Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm-updates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The new rule for inserting an Event in the Poset prescribes that an Event
should only be inserted if its parents belong to the Poset or are referenced
in one of the Roots. The algorithms for computing an Event’s Round and
LamportTimestamp have also changed slightly.</p>
<p>There are six different scenarios to consider when computing an Event’s Round;
each corresponding to a different relationship between the Event and its
creator’s Root.</p>

</table>
<p>Here RoundInc() is the function that computes whether and Event’s Round should
be incremented over its ParentRound. It checks if the Event can StronglySee a
super-majority of clothos from ParentRound, as described in the original
whitepaper.</p>
<p>Note that there is still a possibility for an Event’s OtherParent to refer to an
Event “below” the Frame. This is possible due to the asynchronous nature of the
gossip routines, but is an unlikely scenario. The Frame design tries to find a
compromise between the size and the amount of useful information they contain.
Frames could be made to include more information so as to avoid this type of
problem with greater probability, but such and approach could eventually
undermine the usefulness of Frames as light-weight data points. As we shall see
later, a potential solution to such and edge-case would be to adopt a “let it
crash” philosophy and rely on an other level to handle the burden.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fastforward">
<h2>FastForward<a class="headerlink" href="#fastforward" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Frames may be used to initialize or reset a Poset to a clean state, with
indexes, rounds, blocks, etc., corresponding to a capture of a live run, such
that further Events may be inserted and processed independently of past Events.
Poset Frames are loosely analogous to IFrames in video encoding, which
enable fast-forwarding to any point in the video.</p>
<p>To avoid being tricked into fast-forwarding to an invalid state, the protocol
ties Frames to the corresponding Blockchain by including Frame hashes in
affiliated Block headers. A <em>FastForwardResponse</em> includes a Block and a Frame,
such that, upon receiving these objects, the requester may check the Frame hash
against the Block header, and count the Block signatures against the <strong>known</strong>
set of validators, before resetting the Poset from the Frame.</p>
<p>Note the importance for the requester to be aware of the validator set of the
Poset it wishes to sync with; it is fundamental when it comes to verifying a
Block. With a dynamic validator set, however, an additional mechanism will be
necessary to securely track changes to the validator set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="snapshot-restore">
<h2>Snapshot/Restore<a class="headerlink" href="#snapshot-restore" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is one thing to catch-up with the Poset and Blockchain, but nodes also
need to catch-up with the application state. we extended the Proxy interface
with methods to retrieve and restore snapshots.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">type</span> <span class="n">AppProxy</span> <span class="n">interface</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since snapshots are raw byte arrays, it is up to the application layer to define
what the snapshots represent, how they are encoded, and how they may be used to
restore the application to a particular state. The <em>GetSnapshot</em> method takes a
<em>blockIndex</em> parameter, which implies that the application should keep track of
snapshots for every committed block. As the protocol evolves, we will likely
link this to a <em>FrameRate</em> parameter to reduce the overhead on the application
caused by the need to take all these snapshots.</p>
<p>So together with a Frame and the corresponding Block, a FastForward request
comes with a snapshot of the application for the node to restore the application
to the corresponding state. If the snapshot was incorrect, the node will
immediately diverge from the main chain because it will obtain different state
hashes upon committing new blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improvements-and-further-work">
<h2>Improvements and Further Work<a class="headerlink" href="#improvements-and-further-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The protocol is not entirely watertight yet; there are edge cases that could
quickly lead to forks and diverging nodes.</p>
<p>1) Although it is unlikely, Events above the Frame that reference parents from
“below” the Frame. These Events will fail to be inserted into the Poset, and
the node would stop making progress.</p>
<p>2) The snapshot is not directly linked to the Blockchain, only indirectly through
resulting StateHashes.</p>
<p>Both these issues could be addressed with a general retry mechanism, whereby the
FastForward method is made atomic by working on a temporary copy of the
Poset. If an error or a fork are detected, try to FastSync again from
another Frame. This requires further work and design on fork detection and
self-healing protocols.</p>
